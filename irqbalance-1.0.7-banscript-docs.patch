+Execute the specified script for each irq that is discovered, passing the sysfs
+path to the associated device as the first argument, and the irq vector as the
+second.  An exit value of 0 tells irqbalance that this interrupt should balanced
+and managed as a normal irq, while a non-zero exit code indicates this irq
+should be ignored by irqbalance completely (see --banirq above).  Use of this
+script provides users the ability to dynamically select which irqs get exluded
+from balancing, and provides an opportunity for manual affinity setting in one
+single code point.
